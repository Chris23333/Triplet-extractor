In this paper, AI refers to cutting-edge computationally-intensive AI systems, such as deep neural networks. 
DNNs are responsible for most recent AI breakthroughs, like DeepMind’s AlphaGo, which beat the world champion Go player. 
As suggested above, we use “AI chips” to refer to certain types of computer chips that attain high efficiency and speed for AI-specific calculations at the expense of low efficiency and speed for other calculations
